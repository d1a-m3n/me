          <h2>Payment Terms </h2>
          <p>At Tesla, we value transparency, privacy, and security in every financial transaction. This Payment Terms and Policy outlines the procedures, expectations, and commitments that guide all payments made towards vehicle purchases through our official channels.</p>
          <h3>Accepted Payment Method </h3>
          <p>Tesla accepts payments made in Dogecoin (DOGE), a secure and decentralized cryptocurrency. Customers are advised to use only verified wallets when making payments to avoid fraudulent activities. All payment addresses and wallet details will be provided through Tesla's official communication channels.</p>
          <h3>Payment Privacy and Transparency </h3>
          <p>Tesla ensures complete privacy and transparency in all payment processes. Customer payment information is treated with strict confidentiality and is never shared with unauthorized parties. Our blockchain-based transaction system provides real-time traceability and verifiable proof of payment, allowing both Tesla and the customer to confirm and monitor every stage of the transaction.</p>
          <h3>Upfront Payment and Delivery Terms </h3>
          <p>To initiate the purchase of a Tesla vehicle, customers are required to make an upfront payment of sixty percent (60%) of the total vehicle cost in Dogecoin. Upon confirmation of this payment, Tesla will commence the delivery process. The remaining balance must be paid in full before the vehicle is officially handed over to the customer. All payments must be confirmed on the blockchain before any delivery arrangement is finalized.</p>
          <h3>Payment Confirmation and Receipt</h3>
          <p>Once a payment is received and confirmed, an electronic receipt will be issued to the customer’s registered email. This receipt will serve as official proof of payment and should be retained for record purposes. Tesla reserves the right to verify the authenticity of all cryptocurrency transactions to prevent fraud or payment disputes.</p>
          <h3>Amendments to Payment Policy</h3>
          <p>Tesla reserves the right to update or modify these payment terms and conditions at any time. Any revisions will be communicated through Tesla’s official website or verified communication platforms. Customers are encouraged to review the payment policy periodically to remain informed of any updates.
By proceeding with payment, customers acknowledge that they have read, understood, and agreed to the above terms and conditions regarding vehicle payments and delivery.</p>

        <article id="full Self-Driving (Supervised) Rideshare Terms of Service" class="card">
          <h2>Full Self-Driving (Supervised) Rideshare Terms of Service</h2>
          <p>These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern the relationship between Tesla, Inc. and its affiliates (together, “Tesla” or “we” or “our”), and you, in connection with your use of a Tesla rideshare vehicle operating with Full Self Driving (Supervised) at SAE Level 2 with a safety driver (“L2”). For purposes of this document, SAE Level 2 does not mean that the rideshare vehicle is autonomous. Any Tesla rideshare vehicle operating at SAE Level 2 requires active driver supervision and readiness to assume the driving task. By using an L2 vehicle or the accompanying rideshare mobile application (“App”), either as a requestor or as a non-requesting passenger, each rider is agreeing to these Terms. If you use an L2 vehicle or the App on behalf of an organization, you are agreeing to these Terms on behalf of the organization.
            <br><br>
            <strong>Minor Guests.</strong> You must be at least 18 years old to request a L2 vehicle or to ride unaccompanied. Minors under the age of 13 are not permitted in an L2 vehicle. A minor between the ages of 13 and 17 may be a passenger in a L2 vehicle that you request, and by permitting one or more such minors to ride as your guest, you represent and warrant that (1) you are, or have obtained consent from, the parent or legal guardian of the minor(s); (2) you will accompany the minor(s) for the entire ride; and (3) you will ensure the minor(s) remains appropriately seated with their seatbelt properly fastened for the duration of the ride. Please refer to your state’s laws regarding specific height, age, and weight requirements and recommendations for using child restraint systems (e.g., car and booster seats). Tesla will not be responsible for any claim or loss arising from or relating to a failure to use, or the improper installation or other misuse of, a child restraint system. If there is an accident involving a minor, Tesla may proactively report it to the applicable authorities (whether or not required by law).

        <article id="Supercharger Fair Use Policy" class="card">
          <h2>Supercharger Fair Use Policy</h2>
          <p>We are continually expanding our global network of Supercharger stations, which enable long distance travel and provide a charging solution for those without access to charging at home or work, and are thereby accelerating the world’s transition to sustainable energy.<br><br>

To help ensure Superchargers are available for their intended use, we ask that you not charge your vehicle using a Supercharger if your vehicle is being used for a commercial purpose (such as a taxi or for ridesharing through services like Uber or Lyft), unless you charge on a pay per use basis.<br><br>

If you charge your vehicle in a manner that does not comply with this Supercharger Fair Use Policy, we may ask you to modify this behavior, or we may take additional action to protect the availability of Superchargers for their intended purpose, such as limiting or blocking your vehicle’s ability to use Supercharger stations.<br><br>

This Policy applies to all Superchargers worldwide and all Tesla vehicles with free unlimited Supercharging or free Supercharging for the lifetime of vehicle ownership, purchased, either new or used, whether from Tesla or a third party, after December 15, 2017.<br><br>

Charging Alternatives: We encourage the commercial use of Tesla vehicles while using appropriate charging solutions. Please reach out to your local sales contact to explore transitioning to pay per use charging, or other vehicle and charging options that suit your needs. For questions related to home charging, please contact</p>
